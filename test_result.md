RESULTS: ✅ Text Shadow Removal: All navigation links confirmed with 'text-shadow: none' - the main cause of artificial text thickness has been eliminated. ✅ Font Weight Optimization: Normal navigation links use font-weight: 500 (appropriate thickness), active state uses font-weight: 600 (acceptable for emphasis). ✅ Desktop Navigation: All 5 navigation links (Accueil, TCS, BTS SIO, Projets, Veilles) display with normal text thickness, no artificial boldness detected. ✅ Hover States: Hover effects maintain proper font weight without excessive thickness. ✅ Active States: Active navigation items have appropriate emphasis without appearing overly bold. ✅ Mobile Navigation: Bottom navigation bar displays text with normal thickness, no artificial boldness. ✅ Responsive Design: Text thickness remains consistent across desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024), and mobile (390x844) viewports. ✅ CSS Implementation: Verified in globals.css lines 439-440 (text-shadow: none, font-weight: 500) and line 457 (font-weight: 600 for active state). ✅ Visual Confirmation: Screenshots confirm navigation text appears normal without the previous 'gras' (bold) rendering issue.
